        <h1>Trump Diverts Marines to Gulfport After Mayor's Remark</h1>
        <h2>Gulfport, Florida - June 14, 2025</h2>
        <p>In a bizarre twist to the ongoing conflict between Gulfport's local government and the Trump administration, Mayor Jane Doe's recent comment about the President's hands has led to an unexpected military deployment. After jokingly suggesting that President Trump’s hands were "too small to hold any pens" needed to sign an order for military action, the mayor ignited a firestorm of anger from the President.</p>
        
        <p>Sources reveal that Trump became visibly irate, launching into a rant that included his now-famous phrase, "Person, woman, man, camera, TV," as he defended his ability to sign orders. "I can sign anything! My hands are perfect! Their the biggest and best hands ever! Everyone says how great my hands are!" he reportedly shouted, expressing his frustration over the mayor's remarks.</p>
        
        <p>In a surprising response to the escalating tensions, President Trump ordered that only the non-fat Marines, originally slated to participate in his upcoming birthday military parade, be redirected to Gulfport. "We need to show them who’s in charge," Trump declared, emphasizing that the Marines would be sent to ensure compliance with the state-wide fluoride ban.</p>
        
        <p>As of this writing, the non-fat Marines are en route to Gulfport, creating a sense of urgency and anticipation in the small town. Local officials are bracing for their arrival, with Mayor Doe stating, "We will stand our ground. We will not be intimidated by military threats." The mayor has called for a town hall meeting to discuss the situation and rally community support. Volunteers are being called upon to gather all weapons at hand; pitchforks, shovels, handguns, hunting rifles, and machetes.</p>
        
        <p>The deployment of Marines to Gulfport has drawn mixed reactions from residents. Some express concern over the military presence, while others see it as a necessary measure to uphold state law. "This is getting out of hand," said local resident Sarah Johnson. "We just want to make our own choices about our water." Meanwhile, supporters of the mayor are planning a rally to show solidarity against what they perceive as federal overreach.</p>
        
        <p>As the situation develops, all eyes remain on Gulfport, where the clash between local governance and federal authority continues to unfold. Will the arrival of the Marines escalate tensions further, or will it lead to a resolution? Only time will tell.</p>
